### OOP

* Encapsulation - Class objects are in a specific boundary. For example citizens in a country. They are all living within a specific boundary can governed by its laws.

* Abstraction - Class objects can only share public properties and hide private properties. This creates a great way of controlling its behaviour.

* Inheritance - We can inherit other classes and extend all there public properties.

* Polymorphism - Objects can take various behavior depending on the context.
